# Blog Project

## Overview

The Blog Project is a web application developed as part of the IT course using the SCRUM methodology. The project implements a simple blogging platform where users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and Django for the backend. The development process was managed using JIRA, and version control was handled through Git.
